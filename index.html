        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Helge, I am 21 years old and are born in Norway, currently
          living in the beautiful smalltown Steinkjer. I have always been
          genuinely interested in computers and programming, which is why I
          decided to make it my career.
        </p>

        <p>
          My past proffesional work have mainly been with Angular and
          Typescript. But on my spare time I love to learn more about diffrent
          languages, frameworks and developer tools. My current favorite thing
          to learn about is React and how to make server side components with
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I like to be around friends, exercise and play
          different games. I love to explore different programming languages
          such as pyhton, C#, TypeScript and C++.

          <h2>WoW TBC Compbuilder</h2>
          Wow TBC Compbuilder was a project me and a friend started developing when World of Warcraft re-released World of Warcraft
          TBC expansion. It was a tool for solo players, to make and manage a group of 25+ players, sadly the project was put on hold when my friend got occupied
          with work, and the project was too big for a solo project at the time.
